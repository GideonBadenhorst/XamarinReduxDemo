# Building An F# Redux Store For C# Xamarin Apps

This tiny demo project demonstrates how to implement a basic Redux Store for a C# Xamarin App with the help of F#. For more information about the motivation behind see the [blog post](https://thomasbandt.com/fsharp-redux-store-for-xamarin-apps).

The app is using Xamarin.Forms and supports iOS and Android as target platforms. 

The MVVM Framework in use is [MvvmNano](https://github.com/aspnetde/MvvmNano).
